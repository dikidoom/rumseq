;; midi ruckus
;; FIX
;; - tracks sometimes receive 'empty patterns' from board.
;; TODO / wishlist
;; - bigger note editor (for easier note-edit)
;; - note velocity in note editor (via keypress (1,2,3)?)
;; - more notes in note editor (scrollable view?)
;; - more tracks (scrollable view?)
;; - syncable tracks (start/stop lock),
;; - chained tracks (groups? start/stop together OR play after one another)
;; - smaller board (current is more than big enough)
;; - saving patterns & tracks (inside images, e.g. png stego?) // serialize things
