;; main.rkt
;; rumseq - the Ridiculously Underpowered Midi SEQuencer
;; it's like SEQ24 without the features and for Mac OS X only (because of evhan/coremidi)
;; 
;; FIX
;; - tracks sometimes receive 'empty patterns' from board.
;;   reason: hold is enabled on-drag, which might trigger when cursor is already above different field 
;; TODO / wishlist (prioritized)
;; - note velocity in note editor (via keypress (1,2,3)?)
;; - saving patterns & tracks (inside images, e.g. png stego?) // serialize things
;; - more notes in note editor (scrollable view?)
;; - more tracks (scrollable view?)
;; - syncable tracks (start/stop lock),
;; - chained tracks (groups? start/stop together OR play after one another)
;; DONE
;; - bigger note editor (for easier note-edit)
;; - smaller board (current is more than big enough)
